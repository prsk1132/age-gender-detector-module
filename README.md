### Gender and Age Detector

**Project Overview:**
The Gender and Age Detector is a real-time application that uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to predict the gender and age of individuals from live video feeds. This project leverages Python, Keras, and OpenCV to create an efficient and accurate detection system.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-Time Face Detection:** Utilizes Haar Cascade classifiers to detect faces in real-time from the video feed.
- **Gender Prediction:** Employs a pre-trained neural network model to classify gender into three categories: Male, Female, and Transgender.
- **Age Estimation:** Uses a robust neural network model to estimate the age of the detected individual.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Displays the detected face with annotated gender and age predictions directly on the video feed.

**Technical Details:**
- **Libraries Used:** Python, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy.
- **Models:** Pre-trained models for gender and age prediction, fine-tuned for accuracy.
- **Face Detection:** Implemented using Haar Cascade classifiers provided by OpenCV.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Converts frames to grayscale for face detection and resizes regions of interest for model predictions.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Captures video from the default camera and processes each frame in real-time.

**How It Works:**
1. **Capture Video:** The application captures video from the default camera using OpenCV.
2. **Face Detection:** Each frame is converted to grayscale, and faces are detected using Haar Cascade classifiers.
3. **Gender Prediction:** The detected face region is resized and passed through the gender prediction model to classify the gender.
4. **Age Estimation:** Similarly, the face region is passed through the age prediction model to estimate the age.
5. **Display Results:** The gender and age predictions are displayed on the video feed with annotations.

**Applications:**
- **Security Systems:** Enhancing surveillance systems with demographic analysis.
- **Retail Analytics:** Understanding customer demographics for personalized marketing.
- **Interactive Kiosks:** Providing personalized user experiences in public spaces.

**Future Enhancements:**
- **Improved Accuracy:** Fine-tuning models with larger and more diverse datasets.
- **Additional Features:** Adding emotion detection and other demographic predictions.
- **Deployment:** Developing a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.

**Conclusion:**
The Gender and Age Detector project showcases the power of combining computer vision and machine learning to create practical and impactful applications. It serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the field of AI-driven real-time analysis.
